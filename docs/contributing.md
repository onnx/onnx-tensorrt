# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome to improve the onnx-tensorrt parser. For those looking to contribute, please follow the PR process as outlined in the [TensorRT Open Source Software repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
